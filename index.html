<h2>This is a page about me, Sophia Gilbert</h2>
  <p>The first thing you should know about me is that I never know what to say when someone tells me to talk about myself. Honestly, I've been more stressed about figuring out what to say on this page than the learning to code part. Seriously I have been staring at the computer for the past 45 minutes just at the two above lines I've written thinking about what I should say next.</p>
  <p>To put it simply, I am a sophomore graphic design major at Emmanuel College. I love art, watching movies, and fashion. Art of all forms is and has always been a very important part of my life so on this page youll find a collection of art/installations I find interesting.</p>

<h3> Here is some art I like.</h3>
